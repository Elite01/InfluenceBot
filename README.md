# InfluenceBot
Hi people!
I am working on making a bot for the Android game Influence
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teremok.influence
The bot runs purely on java, uses ADB to communicate with a virtualbox installation of android x86
So far the bot is privately developed, as I am not releasing the virtualbox machine this bot works with.
Once I develop all the features i can think of - I will release the bot to the wild!
